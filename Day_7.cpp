/*

Given two sequences A, B, count number of unique ways in sequence A, to form a subsequence that is identical to the sequence B.

Subsequence : A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, “ACE” is a subsequence of “ABCDE” while “AEC” is not).

Input Format:

The first argument of input contains a string, A.
The second argument of input contains a string, B.
Output Format:

Return an integer representing the answer as described in the problem statement.
Constraints:

1 <= length(A), length(B) <= 700
Example :

Input 1:
    A = "abc"
    B = "abc"
    
Output 1:
    1

Explanation 1:
    Both the strings are equal.

Input 2:
    A = "rabbbit" 
    B = "rabbit"

Output 2:
    3

Explanation 2:
    These are the possible removals of characters:
        => A = "ra_bbit" 
        => A = "rab_bit" 
        => A = "rabb_it"
        
    Note: "_" marks the removed character.
